To build OpFor use a D language 1.x compiler and the Tango library of at least
version 0.99.9. If the compiler is on the path the script build.py will build
the bot.

Running build.py with no arguments builds an optimized executable. Giving
the argument "-static" to the script will build a statically linked executable.
This is probably only useful for meeting the requirements for the Computer
Championship. Any other arguments will be passed directly to the compiler and
will stop the script from giving the compiler it's won default arguments.
